* Payment card industry data security standard
* Provides consistancy
* applies to merchants / service providers that transmit/store cardholder data
* Launched in 2004
* It's a standard, not a low
    * Enforced through contracts between merchants and payment brands
* Payment brands can fine acquring banks for PCI DSS compliance violations
* Acquiring banks can withdraw abilitiy to accept card payments from non-compliant merchants
* Constitutes a GDPR breach
    * Because cardholder data = personal data under the regulation
