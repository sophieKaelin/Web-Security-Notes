## Construction
Identify and evaluate unkeyed inputs
• inject your payload in an unkeyed element
• add random inputs to request and observe impact on the response
   ◇ sometimes hard to notice, there are other techniques listed bellow.
Param Miner
• Extension in Burp
• Right click on request and select “Guess Headers”
• Logged in 2 places:
   ◇ BurpPRO: Issues pane
   ◇ BurpCOM: Extender>Extensions>Param Miner>Output


Elicit harmful response from back-end server
• Evaluate how website processes it
• It is a potential entry for poisoning if:
   ◇ input reflected in response without sanitisation
   ◇ response used to dynamically generate other data

Get response cached
• success depends on file extensions, content type, route, status code, response headers
