## Horizontal Access
Overview
• Access control for specific users, rather than groups
• e.g. banking applications let you view your account + make transactions, but not other people's accounts
• Gaining access to resources that belong to another user.

Basic Tactics
• If there is an ID in the URL params or storage, change it.
   ◇ Can find ID by guessing. Or exploring other places it could be exposes (messages, reviews)
   ◇ Poke around web page and find places the user has interacted in the past (maybe a blog post?)
• If you are getting redirected:
   ◇ Look at response containing redirect (could contain sensitive data)

Horizontal to Vertical privledge escalation
• Try and force the page to react to an admins account to get some info, then log in as admin.

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
• Subcategory of access control vulnerabilities.
• When app uses user-supplied input to access objects directly.
• Explore other files on the system if there is a download link.
• More on another page
Direct reference to DB objects
• If you have access to DB, you can upgrade your own privledges
Direct reference to static files
• sensitive resources sometimes located in static files on server-side filesystem.
• Sometimes files are saved with incrementing values -> if you have been asked to save file4, try and access file3
