## Manipulate Traffic
Intercept/modify messages
• Determine whether sockets are being used (analyse traffic)
• Intercept tab on Burp -> just modify like that

Replaying / Generating new messages
• Send to Burp Repeater
• Send over and over

Manipulate Connections
• Manipulate the handshake
• Enables you to reach more attack surface
• Drop a connection and establish a new one
• Tokens in OG request might be stale and need updating
• How to attack:
   ◇ Burp Repeater
   ◇ Pencil Icon next to WS URL.
      ▪ Attach existing connected WS
      ▪ Clone connected WS
      ▪ Reconnect to disconnected WS
   ◇ Wizrd will show details.

Manipulating message to exploit vulns
• WebSocket History Tab under proxy (Burp)
• tamper with contents of messages
• Messages might be placed in tags (HTML)
• Add an XSS Payload:
   ◇ {"message":"<img src=1 onerror='alert(1)'>"}

Manipulate Handshake to exploit vulns
• Vulnerabilities in the design flaws
• Misplaced trust in headers, like X-Forwarded-For
   ◇ Set IP in header to 127.0.0.1 or 1.1.1.1
• Session-handling flaws
• Custom HTTP headers.

Using XS WS to exploit vulns
• Connect to the dodgy site to create a connection
• Called Cross-Site Webscoket Hijacking (section on it)
• Exploiting CSRF vulnerability
• Serious impact, privledged actions on behalf of user.
