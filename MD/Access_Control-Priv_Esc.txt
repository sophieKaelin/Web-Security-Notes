# Access Control/Priv Esc
What is it?
• Application of constraints on who/what actions can be performed 
• Access control is dependent on authentication and session management.
• Authentication: identifies and confirms user
• Session Management: identifies which HTTP requests are made by same user
• Access Control: determines whether a user can carry out an action

Prevention
• Don't rely on obfuscation for access control
• All non-publically accessible resources should be denied by default
• Use signle application-wide mechanisms for enforcing access controls
• Mandate developers to declare the allowed access for each resource and deny access by default
• Audit and test to ensure they are working as designed.
