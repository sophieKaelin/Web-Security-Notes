# OS Command Inj
What is it?
• aka shell injection
• execute OS commands on server running the application
• Exploit trust relationships to pivot attack to other systems in org

Executing Arbitrary Commands
• Identify when a shell command is being executed, insert something in it
• & echo aiwefwlguh &
   ◇ echo will echo in the output (to test where output is displayed)
   ◇ & is seperator -> command is executed after
   ◇ Good way of checking if there are systems in place
      ▪ If echo was executed
      ▪ if the whole thing was executed

Useful Commands
• whoami = name of current user
• uname -a = OS (linux)
• ver = OS (windows)
• ifconfig = network config (add an “ /all” at the end for windows)
• netstat -an = network connections
• ps -ef = Running processes (linux)
• tasklist = Runing processes (windows)

Prevention
• never call out OS commands from application layer
   ◇ Always another way of doing this
• If unavoidable : input validation!
   ◇ Allowlists
   ◇ insure it is correct datatype (e.g. phone number is integer)
   ◇ no whitespace or other syntax (alphanumeric)
• Don't bother trying to sanitise input by escaping shell matacharacters, there are so many ways around it
