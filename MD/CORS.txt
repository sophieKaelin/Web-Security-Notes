# CORS
What is it?
• Cross Origin Resource Sharing
• Browser mechanism enabling controlled access to resources located outside given domain
• Extends Same-origin policy (adds more flexibility)
• Provides potential for cross-domain based attacks
   ◇ if configuration and implementation is poor.
• Not a protection against Cross-origin attacks like CSRF

Prevention
• Usually issues come from misconfigurations
• Only allow trusted sites, only trusted sites in ACAO
• Avoid whitelisting Null and wildcards
   ◇ especially in internal networks
• CORS defines browser behaviours, not server-side protection
   ◇ web servers need to apply protections over sensitive data (authentication, session management) in addition to everything else
