# Scanning
Definitions
Passive Scan- look at existing requests coming through and scanning them for vulnerabilities
Active Scan - Sends manipulated requests to the server in order to expose vulnerabilities. Need to be careful

Active Scan in Burp
• Make sure to set your scope in Target -> site map (should have done this when setting up burp)
• Send request to Intruder to define insertion points
• Right Click -> Scan defined Insertion points -> scan configs -> new
   ◇ Audit Optimisation -> turn off any redirections
   ◇ Resource pool -> create new resource pool (for throttling traffic) stops from hammering with requests
      ▪ Max concurrent requests = 2
      ▪ Delay = 200
• Scan progress and results will appear in dashboard
• Choose a good request 
   ◇ probably not one that creates/updates/deletes data
   ◇ GET requests are good
   ◇ Choose interesting ones (e.g. ones that pull data from db's as opposed to plain HTML pages)
