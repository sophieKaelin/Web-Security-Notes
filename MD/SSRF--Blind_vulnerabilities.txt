## Blind vulnerabilities
Overview
• When the back-end response is not returned in apps front-end
• Impact often lower than full SSRF vulnerabilities (one way nature)
• Could possibly get RCE

How to find and exploit
• Use OAST techniques
• Trigger HTTP request to external system you control
• Burp Collaborator
• NOTE: Often HTTP blocked by network, but you can do a sneaky with DNS
• Change the referer to your website to check for the response 
• If HTTP request observered coming in from the app, you can do an SSRF

How to attacks
• Leverage to probe for other vulnerabilities on server
• Blindly sweep internal IP address space
