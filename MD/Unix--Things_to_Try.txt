Things to Try

• See if someone has typed their password into the shell rather than the password prompt
   ◇ View their history, and search for lines with a call to “passwd”
   ◇ grep passwd .bash_history
   ◇ line after passwd prompt : grep -A 1 passwd .bash_history
• View the /tmp and /var/tmp folder (maybe something wasn't cleared on reboot) 
• View /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow
   ◇ If you get passwords, try cracking them in John 
      ▪ (if they are DES) : john file.txt --format=descrypt
      ▪ (if they are md5) -> usually has format $1$ : john file.txt --format=md5crypt
• cron system backup check
   ◇ Cron is used to backup files
   ◇ usually find in /etc/cron.daily
• Search for tomcat on the systems to find username and passwords
• Set what commands you can run, and with what privledges
   ◇ sudo -l
   ◇ then run as that user: sudo -u USER <COMMAND>
   ◇ Search how to get various shells using the commands being run (maybe vim or less?)
• Change permissions on files to run as root or another user.
   ◇ Permissions and chmod
