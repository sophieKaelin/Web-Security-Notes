# JWT
Types of Signatures
• Multiple signature methods to ensure integrity
   ◇ RSA (RS256) based -> Private to encode and Public key to decode
   ◇ Elliptic curves
   ◇ HMAC (HS256) -> Sign/Verify with same secret
   ◇ None

Vulnerabilities
• None singing.
• If RSA is being used and alg type isn't verified
   ◇ change it to HMAC (since you only need public key, and public key for RSA is available to decode)
