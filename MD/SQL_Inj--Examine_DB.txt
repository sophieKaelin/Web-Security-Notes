## Examine DB
Querying DB Type and Version
• Different db's have different ways of querying. Try different commands to determine what type of DB in use

• Incorporate this into a UNION attack
• ORACLE: every SELECT must specify a FROM
   ◇ There is a built in table called DUAL if you need to provide one.

Listing the contents of the database
• Most (except Oracle) have an information table in the db
• SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables
   ◇ Finds the name of all the tables
   ◇ Columns in this table include: table_name, table_type
• SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = ‘<INSERT_NAME>’
   ◇ Returns the columns from the specified table.
   ◇ Columns in this table include: column_name, data_type
• From here seach for tables with things like “user credentials” in it.
• Use the information you discovered from your union attack, to display the information.

• What about Oracle?
• Oracle has different commands:
• SELECT * FROM all_tables
• SELECT * FROM all_tab_columns WHERE table_name = ‘USERS’
   ◇ Columns like: table_name, column_name are handy to check. You can always google others.
