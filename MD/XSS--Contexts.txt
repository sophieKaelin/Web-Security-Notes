## Contexts
• Especially important for reflected/stored XSS

XSS Between HTML Tags
• Introduce some new HTML tags to trigger JS

When it seems most tags are blocked
• Test out some tags and attributes. If you can't find any, send it to the intruder in Burp to test out which tags and attributes aren't blocked, and leverge them to perform the attack.
