## Security Models
What is it?
• Formally defined definition of set access control rules independent of tech + implementation platform
• Implemented outside of OS, Networks, DBMS, back office, app and server software
• Various styles:

Programmatic access control
• matrix of user privledges stored in DB applied programmaticly, 
• Includes roles, groups, individual users, collections, workflows, processes
• Granular

Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
• constraints based on users or named groups of users
• Owners of resources/functions delegate access permissions
• Very complex to design and manage (lots of individuals in charge of delegating access)

Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
• centrally controlled system of controls
• Very different to DAC : new user control over access
• Associated with military clearance-based systems

Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
• Named roles desined to which access privledges assigned
• Users assigned 1+ roles
• Enhanced management over models.
• Easy to revoke and define group membership
