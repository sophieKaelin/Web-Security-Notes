## Exploit
Follow this order of steps to perform an exploit

Read
* Read documentation of the template engine

Learn Basic Template Syntax
* Learn how to embed native code blocks
* E.G. Python-based Mako template
<%
	import os
	x=os.popen('id').read()
%>
${x}
* How do you evaluate an expression to display on the page?
   	* {% %}
* How do you execute arbitrary OS commands? System()?
   	* `ls`
   	* import os module?
* Update stuff, make sure you know where that change would reflect.

Read about security implementations
* Read through this in the documentation if it's there
* Look for other warnings -> developers may not have taken notice of these, try and exploit them

Look for known exploits
* Google for known exploits associated with the template/language (mostly template)

Explore
* Look for “self” or “environment” objects
   	* use to generate list of objects, methods, attributes
* Look for other objects (created by the developer)
   	* likely to contain sensitive info or material
* Study objects behaviour in context of each template
* Doesn't have to be RCE, directory traversal is still pretty impressive (you can gain some data)

Create a custom attack
* if there is no obvious way to exploit the vulnerability, review each function for exploitable behaviour

Using an object chain
- find what variables and methods you have access to
- Chain arguments like that to gain access to things, or see if you can execute something through chaining

Using developer-supplied objects
