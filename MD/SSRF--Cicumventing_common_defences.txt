## Cicumventing common defences
Blocklist based input filters
• Sometimes 127.0.0.1 is blocked
   ◇ Try 2130706433
   ◇ Try 017700000001
   ◇ Try 127.1
   ◇ Create your own domain name that resolves to 127.0.0.1
   ◇ Obfuscate blocked strings with url encoding -> double encode 
   ◇ Try each one bit by bit before you visit sub directories

Allowlist based input filters
• Some allow input that matches, begins with/contains allowlist permitted values
   ◇ embed credentials into url before hostname https://expected-host@evil-host
   ◇ use # to indicate URL fragmanet https://evil-host#expected-host
   ◇ Leverage DNS naming to have DNS name you control https://expected-host.evil-host.
   ◇ URL encode characters to confuse parser

Bypassing filters via open redirection
• API used to make back-end HTTP request must support redirections
• Construct URL that satisfies filter & refirests to back-end target
• Add a path=ashjfkhsalkjfsh at the end of your URL
   ◇ ACTUALLY: add it to your parameter if it is being passed in as a URL parameter
   ◇ Have some of the correct structure in case there is some checking.
