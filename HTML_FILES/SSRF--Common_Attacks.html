When connection made back to server itself, check is bypassed<br />• For disaster recovery. App might allow admin access without logging in.<br />• Admin interface might be listening on different port number than main app (not reachable directly by users)<br /><br /><strong>Attacks against other back-end systems</strong><br />• Some servers have access to other back-end systems<br />   ◇ These aren&#39;t usually as well protected either, because you assumed people wont know about them.<br />• Use the same process as above to change API parameter to access this extra system.<br /><br /></div></body></html>
