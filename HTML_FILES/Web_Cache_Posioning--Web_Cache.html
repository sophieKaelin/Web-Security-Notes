    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Web Cache</h1><br/><strong>How does it work?</strong><br />• If server had to send new response to every HTTP request seperately, would overload server<br />   ◇ cause latency<br />• Cache sits between user and server<br />• Save responses to particular requests for amount of time.<br /><strong><br />What are Cache Keys?</strong><br />• When recieving a request, determine if there is a cached response or not.<br />• cache key = predefined subset of request&#39;s components<br />   ◇ usually includes request line and host header<br />• EXPLOITABLE FEATURE: all other components (unkeyed) are ignored by the cache<br />   ◇ We can add some naughty things in there maybeee?<br /></div></body></html>
