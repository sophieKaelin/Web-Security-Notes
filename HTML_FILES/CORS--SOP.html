    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>SOP</h1><br/><strong>Overview</strong><br />• Same Origin Policy<br />• TLDR: stops websites attacking each other and stealing resources<br />• restrictive cross-origin spec limiting ability for website to interact with resources outside of their domain<br />• Developed in response to malicious cross-domain interations (stealing private data from other sites)<br />• allows domain to issue requests to other domains, but not to access the responses.<br />• Origin: URI scheme, domain, port number<br />   ◇ must have the same of all of them (URI=HTTP/HTTPS)<br />   ◇ Port number doesn&#39;t have to be the same on Internet explorer.<br /><strong><br />Why is it necessary?</strong><br />• When sending request from one origin to another, cookies are also sent as part of the request.<br />• If session cookie is passed on to malicious site, they can use that cookie to access your profile on other sites visited previously<br /><strong><br />How is the policy implemented?</strong><br />• SOP controlls JS access to content loaded cross-domain<br />• Does allow embedding of images via &lt;img&gt; and &lt;video&gt;<br />   ◇ JS can&#39;t read these contents, or anything else.<br />• Exceptions:<br />   ◇ Some objects writeable but not readable cross-domain (location, location.href from iframes/new windows)<br />   ◇ Some objects readable but not writeable cross-domain (length of window object, closed)<br />   ◇ Replace can be called cross-domain on location object<br />   ◇ Some other functions can be called cross-domain (close, blur, focus on new window. postMessage on iframes/new windows)<br />• Partially mitigate cookie travelling using HttpOnly cookie flag<br />• Relax policy using document.domain for a specific domain<br />   ◇ only if it&#39;s part of your FQDN (fully qualified domain name)</div></body></html>
