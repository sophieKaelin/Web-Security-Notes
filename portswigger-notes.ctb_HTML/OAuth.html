    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>OAuth</h1><br/>• Log in using social media / google account<br />• extremly common use of authentication<br />• prone to implementation mistakes<br />• note: these are specific to OAuth 2.0<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">What is OAuth</span><br />• enables websites to request limited access to a user&#39;s account on another application<br />• grants this access without exposing a users login credentials to the requesting application<br />• e.g. can be used to gain access to email contact list -&gt; but that functionality can be exploited to gain more information<br />• 1.0 and 2.0 are very different (since 2.0 was written from scratch)<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">How does it work</span><br />• Defines a series of interactions between 3 parties<br />   ◇ Client app (who wants to access the data)<br />   ◇ Resource owner (user with data the client wants to access)<br />   ◇ OAuth service provider (website/app that controls the user&#39;s data/access to it. Provides API for interacting)<br />• Different ways of being implemented (flows/grant types)<br />   ◇ Authorization code and implicit are the most common<br />   ◇ 1. Client requests access to subset of data. Specify which grant type and what kind of access they want<br />   ◇ 2. User prompted to log in to OAuth service (give consent)<br />   ◇ 3. Client app recieves unique access token (proves permission granted from user to access data). This step varies by grant type<br />   ◇ 4. Client application uses access token to make API calls to resource server</div></body></html>
